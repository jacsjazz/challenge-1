# Code-Refactor 

## User Story 
 As a boot camp student, I have refactored a non semantic code that was provided and worked to make it a semantic code. I was also tasked with adding accessibility elements so that the site is optimized for search engines.
 
 ## Features 
A code is provided with semantic HTML elements. 
Images have alt attributes. 
Title Element has a short descriptive title. 
Comments were added to the CSS Styling sheet.   
Links are now working properly.
